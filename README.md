##### Human Genome Dataset

- generated by getting 512 length sequences beginning at every position
- used [Genome assembly GRCh38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.26/) as data source
- excluded sequences containing 'N's but probably better to replace with the unknown token
